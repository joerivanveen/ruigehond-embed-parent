# Ruigehond embed parent

Lightweight companion for the full [Ruigehond embed](https://github.com/joerivanveen/ruigehond-embed) plugin, to use on the embedding sites.

When enabled, use the shortcode \[ruigehond-embed-parent src="&lt;Iframe src&gt;"] to embed urls from sites where the full version of ruigehond-embed is installed.

This code is also contained in the regular Ruigehond embed plugin.
